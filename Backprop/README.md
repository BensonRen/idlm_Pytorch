# Back Propagation model
## This is the Back propagation model implemented by Ben in Pytorch, transfering from previous tf version 
# Developer Log:

### RoadMap for this work:
1. Identify the difference between the back prop model with the forward model
2. Implement them

## 2019.12.04
Function completed:
1. Copied from forward model


# To-do list
1. Boundary loss (New feature during evaluation mode)
2. Evaluation parameters to train
3. Initialize the geometry parameters
