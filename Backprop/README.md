# Back Propagation model
## This is the Back propagation model implemented by Ben in Pytorch, transfering from previous tf version 
# Developer Log:

### RoadMap for this work:
1. Identify the difference between the back prop model with the forward model
2. Implement them

## 2019.12.04
Function completed:
1. Copied from forward model
2. Boundary loss (New feature during evaluation mode)
3. Evaluation parameters to train
4. Initialize the geometry parameters
5. CPU version tested
6. Bug fixed with non decreasing evaluation loss 

## 2019.12.05
1. Parameter.py commented and segmented
# To-do list
