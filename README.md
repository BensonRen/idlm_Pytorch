# Inverse deisng for meta-material using deep learning
## Author: Ben Ren

### This is a transfering repo from the idlm_Ben which is in tensorflow into the current Pytorch version.

#### There would be 5 models in this repo
#### Finished Models:
1. forward model (The christian's model mapping from geometry to spectra) 
2. Backpropagation model
3. Tandem model
4. Variational Auto-Encoder model
5. Convolutional Generative Adverserial Network model

#### Models working now:
1. Invertible Neural Network

#### Models to be worked on:

Please see into the folder of each model and see the README file for developer log for more details of the progress.
